## Overview

This Tampermonkey script is part of a userscript that enhances GitHub's functionality by providing alternative download and clone sources for repositories. These sources are globally distributed üåç and provided by various entities. The script aims to improve the speed üöÄ and reliability üîí of operations by allowing users to choose a geographically close or otherwise suitable source. Some sources also offer caching for faster subsequent operations. Please note that some sources are currently inactive due to various issues. ‚ö†Ô∏è
